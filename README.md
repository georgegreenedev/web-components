# Web Components

Hobbyist experiments with custom UI elements.

## What?

Web components offer an encapsulated, portable solution for building UI components. This [NDC](https://youtu.be/-USODEI-kgg) talk is a good introduction. You can also read more about them at [MDN](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components>). I'll keep my own web components in this repository.

## Why?

I want to learn the technology, explore what's possible, and craft components for personal and professional use. I've encountered problems with other component libraries (extensibility, interoperability, etc), and I think web components are a potential solution to those issues.

## When?

I'll post updates here as things move along, but be aware that this exercise is primarily for leisure - these components should not be used in production environments. If I feel that a component is stable enough for production environments, I will mark it as such and look into options for releasing it.

## Components

| Element | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Combobox** | *WIP* | Text input with a multi-select dropdown menu, typeahead search functionality, and virtual scrolling for large lists |
